had die d tool on gag of or her to have more than an indistinct 
remembrance of her caress e sand her place had been sup p lie d 
by ane x cell ent woman as governess who had fallen little short 
of am other in affection 
sixteen years had miss t ay l orb e e n in m r wood house s family 
less as ago v er n e s s than a friend very fond of both daughter s 
but particularly of e m ma between them it was more the intimacy 
of sister seven before miss t ay l or had cease d to hold then o m in al 
office of governess them i l d n e s so f her temper had hardly allowed 
her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being 
now long passe daw ay they had been living together as friend and 
friend very mutual l y attached and e m mad o in g just what she like d 
highly esteem in g miss t ay l or s judgment but direct e d chiefly by 
hero w n 
there ale v i l sin deed of e m mass it u at ion were the power of ha v in g 
rather too much hero w n way and ad is position tot hin k al it t l e 
too well of herself these were the disadvantage s which threaten e d 
alloy to her many enjoyment s the danger however was at present 
sou n perceive d that they did not by any means rank as misfortune s 
with her 
sorrow came agent l e sorrow but not at all in the shape of any 
disagreeable consciousness miss t ay l or married it was miss 
t ay l or s loss which first brought grief it was on the wedding day 
of this beloved friend that e m ma first satin mournful thought 
of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone 
her father and herself were left tod in e together with no prospect 
of at hi r d to cheer along evening her father composed himself 
to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit 
and think of what she had lost 
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend m r west on 
was am an of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age 
and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering 
with what self deny in g generous friendship she had always wish e d 
and promote d them at c h but it was a black morning s work for her 
the want of miss t ay l or would be felt every hour of everyday 
she recall e d her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen 
years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five 
years old how she had devoted all her power stoat tach and amuse 
her in health and how nurse d her through the various illness e s 
of childhood al a r g e debt of gratitude was owing here butt he 
intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect 
un reserve which had soon follow e d is abe l la s marriage on their 
being left toe a c hot her was yet ad ear er tenderer recollection 
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent 
well inform e d useful gentle knowing all the way soft he family 
interested in all its concern sand peculiarly interested in herself 
in every pleasure every scheme of hers one tow ho m she could speak 
every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her 
as could never find fault 
how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was 
going only half am i l e from them but e m maw as aware that great must 
bet he difference between am r s west on only half am i l e from them 
and amiss t ay l or in the house and withal l her advantage s 
natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering 
from intellectual solitude shed early love d her father but he 
was no companion for her he could not meet her in conversation 
rational or playful 
the evil of the actual disparity in their age sand m r wood house had 
not married early was much increase d by his constitution and habit s 
for ha v in g been a valetudinarian all his life without activity 
of mind orb o d y hew as am u c holder man in way s than in years

from such thought s but when tea came it was impossible for him 
not to say exactly ash eh ad said at dinner

forever and bear all my odd humour s when she might have ah o use of hero w n 
ah o use of hero w n ! but where is the advantage of ah o use of hero w n 
this is three times as large and you haven ever any odd humour s

ah ! poor miss t ay l or ! t is as ad business 
poor m rand miss wood house if you please but i cannot possibly 
say ` poor miss t ay l or i have a great regard for you and e m ma 
but when it come s tot he question of dependence or independence ! at 
any rate it must be better to have only one top lease than two 
especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature ! 
said e m map lay fully that is what you have in your head 
i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by 
i believe it is very true my dear indeed said m r wood house 
with as i g hi am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome 
my dear e s t papa ! you don o t think i could mean you or suppose 
m r knight l e y tome any o u what ah or rib l e idea ! oh no ! i meant 
only myself m r knight l e y love s to find fault with me you know 
in a joke it is all a joke weal way s say what we like too n e another 
m r knight l e y in fact was one of the few people who could see 
fault sine m maw o o d house and the only one whoever told hero f them : 
and thought his was not particularly agreeable toe m ma herself 
she knew it would be so much less sot oh er father that she would 
not have him really suspect such a circumstance ash er not being 
thought perfect bye very body 
e m ma know sine v er flatter hers aid m r knight l e y but i 
meant nor e flection on anybody miss t ay l or has been used 
to have two person stop lease she will now have but one 
the chance s are that she must be again er 
well said e m maw ill in g to let it pass you want to hear 
about the wedding and is hall be happy tot ell you for weal l 
behave d charming lye very body wasp un c t u ale very body in their 
best look s : not ate a rand hardly along facet obese e no h no 
weal l felt that we were going to be only half am i leap art 
and were sure of meeting everyday 
dear e m ma bear sever y thing sow ell said her father 
but m r knight l e y she is really very sorry to lose poor miss t ay l or 
and i am sure she will miss her more than she think s for 
e m mat urn e daw ay her head divide d between tear sands mile s 
it is impossible that e m mash o u l d not miss such a companion 
said m r knight l e y we should not like hers owe l la s wed o sir 
if we could suppose it but she know show much them a r r i age is to 
miss t ay l or sad vantage she know show very acceptable it must be 
at miss t ay l or s time of life to beset t led in ah o me of hero w n 
and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision 
and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain asp lea sure 
every friend of miss t ay l or must beg lad to have hers oh ap p i l y 
married 
and you have forgotten one matter of joy tome said e m ma 
and aver y considerable one that i made them at c h myself 
i made them at c h you know four years ago and to have it take place 
and be prove dint her i g h t when so many people said m r west on would 
never marry again may comfort me for anything 
m r knight l e y shook his head at her her father fondly re p lie d 
ah ! my dear i wish you would not make match e sand foretell thing s 
for whatever you say always come stop ass pray don o t make any 
more match e s

after such success you know ! everybody said that m r west on would

some people event al k e do f ap r o m is e to his wife on herd eat h bed 
and other soft he son and the uncle not let ting him all manner 
of solemn nonsense was talk e don the subject but i believe d none 
of it 
ever since the day about four years ago that miss t ay l or and i 
met with him in broadway lane when because it began tod r i z z l e 
he dart e daw ay with so much gallantry and borrow e d two umbrella s 
for us from farmer mit c hell si made up my mind on the subject 
i plan n e d them at c h from that hour and when such success has blessed 
me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that is hall leave 
off match making 
i don o tun de r stand what you mean by ` success said m r knight l e y 
success suppose send e a v our your time has been properly and 
delicately spent if you have been endeavour in g forth e last four 
years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment foray o un g 
lady s mind ! but if which i rather imagine your making them at c h 
as you call it means only your planning it yours ay in g toy ourself 
one idle day ` it hin kit would beaver y good thing form is stay l or 
if m r west on were tom a r r y her and saying it again toy ourself 
every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where 
is your merit what are you proud of you made al u c k y guess 
and that is all that can be said 
and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of al u c k y guess 
i pity you it ho u g h t you clever er ford e pen d upon it al u c k y 
guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it 
and as tom y poor word ` success which you quarrel with i don o t 
know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn 
two pretty picture s but it hin k there maybe at hi r d as o met hin g 
between the don o thing and the do all if i had not promote d m r west on s 
visit she re and given many little encouragement sands moot he d 
many little matter sit might not have comet o anything after all 
it hin k you must know hart field enough to comprehend that 
as t r a i g h t forward open hearted manlike west on and a rational 
unaffected woman like miss t ay l or maybe safely left tom an age their 
own concern s you are more likely to have done harm toy ourself 
than good tot hem by interference 
e m mane v er think so f herself if she can dog o o d tooth er s 
rejoin e d m r wood house understanding but in part but my dear 
pray don o t make any more match e s they are silly thing sand break up 
ones family circle grievous l y 
only one more papa only form re l ton poor m re l ton ! you 
like m re l ton papa i must look about for a wife for him 
there is nobody in high bury who deserve s him and he has been 
here a whole year and has fit ted up his house so comfortably

ha r r i e t smith sin t i ma c y at hart field was soon as e t t led thing 
quick and decided in her way s e m ma lost not i me in inviting e n co u rag in g 
and tell in g her to come very often and as their acquaintance increase d 
sod i d theirs at is faction in each other as a walking companion 
e m ma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her 
in that respect mrs west on s loss had been important her father 
never went beyond the shrubbery where two division soft he ground 
suffice d him for his long walk or hiss ho r t as they ear varied 
and since mrs west on s marriage here x er c is eh ad been too much confine d 
she had venture don c e alone to rand all s but it was not pleasant 
and aha r r i e t smith therefore one whom she could summon at any 
time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privilege s 
but in every respect ass he saw more of hers heap prove d her 
and was confirm e din all her kind design s 
ha r r i e t certainly was not clever but she had as wee t docile 
grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only de sir in g 
to beg u i de d by anyone she look e d up to here a r l y attachment 
to herself was very amiable and her inclination forgo o d company 
and power of ap pre c i at in g what was elegant and clever she wed that 
there was now ant of taste though strength of understanding must 
not bee x pe c ted altogether she was quite convinced of ha r r i e t 
smith s being exactly they o un g friend she want e de x act l y the 
something which her homer e quire d such a friend as mrs west on 
was out of the question two such could never beg rant e d 
two such shed i d not want it was quite ad iff ere n t sort of thing 
as ent i men t distinct and independent mrs west on was the object 
of are g a r d which had its basis ingratitude and esteem 
ha r r i e two u l d beloved as one tow ho m she could be useful 
form r s west on there was nothing to bed one for ha r r i e t everything 
her first attempt sat usefulness were inane n de a v our to find out who 
were the parents but ha r r i e t could not tell she was ready tot ell 
everything in her power but on this subject questions were vain 
e m maw as oblige d to fancy what she like d but she could never 
believe that in the same situation she should not have discover e d 
the truth ha r r i e t had no penetration she had been satisfied 
to hear and believe just what mrs god d a r d chose tot ell her 
and look e d no farther 
mrs god d a r d and the teacher sand the girls and the affair soft he 
schooling e n era l formed naturally a great part of the conversation and 
but for her acquaintance with them art in sofa b bey mill farm 
it must have been the whole butt hem art in so c cup i e d her thought s 
ago odd e al she had spent two very happy month s with them 
and now love d total k of the pleasure so f her visit and describe 
them any comfort sand wonder soft he place e m ma encouraged her 
talkative n e s s amuse d by such ap i c t u re of another set of beings 
and enjoy in g they out h f u l simplicity which could speak with so much 
exultation of mrs martin shaving two parlour s two very good parlour s 
indeed one of them quite as large as mrs god d a r d s drawing room 
and of her ha v in g an upper maid who had live d five and twenty years 
with her and of their ha v in g eight cow s two of them alder n e y s 
and one al it t l ewe l c h cow aver y pretty little we l c h cow indeed 
and of mrs martin s saying ass hew ass of on do fit its ho u l d be 
called her cow and of their ha v in gave r y handsome summer house 
in their garden where someday next year they were all tod rink 
tea : aver y handsome summer house large enough to hold ado z e n people 
for sometimes hew as amuse d without thinking beyond the immediate cause 
but ass he came to understand the family better other feelings arose 
she had taken up a wrong idea fancy in git was am other and daughter 
as on and son s wife whoa l l live d together but when it appear e d 
that them r martin who bore apart in then a r rat i v e and was always 
mention e d with approbation for his great good nature in doings o met hin g 
or other was as ingle man that there was no young mrs martin 
now if e in the cases he did suspect danger to her poor little 
friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she 
were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever 
with this inspirit in g notion her questions increase din number 
and meaning and she particularly led ha r r i e t total k more of m r martin 
and there was evidently nod is like to it ha r r i e t was very ready 
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walk sand merry 
evening games and dwelt ago odd e al upon his beings over y good humour e d 
and obliging he had gone three mile s round one day in order to bring 
hers o mew al nut s because she had said how fond she was of them 
and in everything else hew ass over y obliging he had his 
shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her 
she was very fond of singing he could sing al it t l eh i m self 
she believe d hew as very clever and understood everything 
he had aver y fine flock and while she was with them 
he had been bid more for his wool than anybody in the country 
she believe de very body spoke well of him his mother and sister s 
were very fond of him mrs martin had told heron e day and there 
was a blush ass he said it that it was impossible for anybody 
to be abet t er son and therefore she was sure whenever hem a r r i e d 
hew o u l d make ago o d husband not that she want e d him tom a r r y 
she was inn oh u r r y at all 
well done mrs martin ! thought e m may o uk now what you area bout 
and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send 
mrs god d a r dab e a u t if u l goose the fine s t goose mrs god d a r d had 
ever seen mrs god d a r d had dress edit on as un day and ask e d all 
the three teacher s miss n ash and miss prince and miss richardson 
to sup with her 
m r martin is up pose is not am an of information beyond the line 
of his own business he does not read 
oh yes ! that is no i don o t know but i believe he has 
read ago odd e al but not what you would think anything of 
here ad s the agricultural report sands o me other books that lay 
in one of the window seat s but here ad s all them to himself 
but sometimes of ane v e n in g before we went to card she would read 
something aloud out of the elegant extract s very entertaining 
and i know he has read the vicar of wake field hen ever read the 
romance of the forest north e children of the abbey he had never 
heard of such books before i mention e d them but he is determined 
to get them now ass o on as ever he can 
then ex t question was 
what sort of looking man is m r martin 
oh ! not handsome not at all handsome it ho u g h t him very plain 
at first but i don o t think him sop lain now one does not you know 
after at i me but did you never see him he is in high bury every 
now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way 
to king s ton he hasp ass e d you very often 
that maybe and i may have seen him fifty times but without 
ha v in g any idea of his name ay o un g farmer whether on horseback 
or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity 
they e o man r y are precisely the order of people with whom if eel i 
can haven o thing tod o ad e g ree ort w o lower and acre dit able 
appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful tot heir 
f am i lie sin some way or other but afar me r can need none of my help 
and is therefore in ones e n sea s much above my notice as in every 
other he is below it 
to be sure oh yes ! it is not likely you should ever have 
observe d him but he know s you very well indeed i mean by sight 
i haven o doubt of his being aver y respectable young man 
i know indeed that he is so and ass u c h wish him well 
what do you imagine his age to be 
hew as four and twenty the 8 tho f last j un e and my birthday is 
the 2 3 r d just a fortnight and ad ay s difference which is very odd 
only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is 
perfectly right not to be in ah u r r y they seem very comfortable 
as they area n d if she were tot a k e any pain stoma r r y him 
she would probably repent its i x years hence if he could meet 
with ago o d sort of young woman in the same rank ash is own 
withal it t lemon e y it might be very desirable 
six years hence ! dear miss wood house hew o u l d bet hi r t y years old ! 
well and that is as early as most men can afford tom a r r y 
whoa re not born to an independence m r martin i imagine 
hash is fortune entirely tom a k e cannot beat all beforehand with 
the world whatever money hem i g h t come into when his father die d 
whatever hiss hare of the family property it is i dare say 
all afloat all employe din hiss to c k and so forth and though 
with diligence and good luck hem ay be rich in time it is next to 
impossible that he should have realise d anything yet 
to be sure so it is butt hey live very comfortably 
they haven o indoors mane l set hey don o t want for anything 
and mrs martin talk soft akin g a boy another year 
i wish you may not get into as crape ha r r i e t whenever he does 
marry i mean as to being acquaint e d with his wife forth o u g h 
hiss is t er s from as up er i ore ducat ion are not to be altogether 
object e d to it does not follow that hem i g h t marry anybody at all fit 
for you ton o t ice them is fortune of your birth ought tom a key o u 
particularly careful as toy our associate s there can ben o doubt 
of your being agent leman s daughter and you must support your 
claim tot hat station bye very thing within your own power ort here 
will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in de grading you 
yes to be sure is up pose there are but while i visit 
at hart field and you are so kind tome miss wood house 
i am not afraid of what anybody can do 
you understand the force of influence pretty well ha r r i e t but i 
would have you so firmly established in goods o c i e t y as to be 
independent even of hart field and miss wood house i want to see you 
permanently well connected and tot hate n dit will bead visa b l e 
to have as few odd acquaintance as maybe and therefore is ay 
that if you should still be in this country when m r martin mar r i e s 
i wish you may not bed raw n in by your intimacy with thesis t er s 
to be acquaint e d with the wife who will probably be some mere 
farmer s daughter without education 
to be sure yes not that it hin k m r martin would ever marry anybody 
but what had had some education and been very well brought up 
however i don o t meant o setup my opinion against yours and i 
am sure is hall not wish forth e acquaintance of his wife is hall 
always have a great regard forth e miss martin s especially e l i z abet h 
and should be very sorry to give them up forth e y are quite as well 
educated as me but if hem a r r i e saver y ignorant vulgar woman 
certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it 
e m maw at c he d her through the fluctuation soft hiss pe e c h 
and saw no alarming symptom so f love they o un g man had been 
the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold 
and that there would ben o serious difficulty on ha r r i e t s side 
too p pose any friendly arrangement of hero w n 
they met m r martin the very next day as they were walking on the 
don well road hew as on foot and after looking very respectfully 
at her look e d with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion 
e m maw as not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey 
and walking a few yard s forward while they talk e d together soon made 
her quick eye sufficiently acquaint e d with m r robert martin 
his appearance was very neat and he look e d like as e n si b l e young man 
but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be 
contrast e d with gentlemen she thought hem us t lose all the ground 
he had gain e din ha r r i e t sin c l in at ion ha r r i e t was not insensible 
of manners he had voluntarily notice d her father s gentleness 
with admiration as well as wonder m r martin look e d as if he 
did not know what manner was 
they remain e d but a few minute s together as miss wood house must 
not be kept waiting and ha r r i e t then came running to her with a 
s mil in g face and in a flutter of spirits which miss wood house 
hope d very soon to compose 
the other day 
she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn 
from m re l ton and now did full justice to and ha r r i e t blush e d 
and smile d and said she had always thought m re l ton very agreeable 
m re l ton was the very person fixed on bye m ma ford r i v in g 
they o un g farmer out of ha r r i e t she ad she thought it would 
bean excellent match and only too pal pa b l y desirable natural 
and probable for her to have much merit in planning it 
she fear edit was whatever y body else must think of and predict 
it was not likely however that anybody should have equal led 
her in the date of the plan as it had enter e d herb rain during 
the very first evening of ha r r i e t s coming to hart field the long er 
she considered it the greater washer sense of its expediency 
m re l ton s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself 
and without low connexion sat the same time not of any family 
that could fairly object tot he doubtful birth of ha r r i e the had a 
comfortable home for her and e m maim a gin e d aver y sufficient income 
forth ought he vicarage of high bury was not large hew ask now n 
to have some independent property and she thought very highly 
of him as ago o d humour e dwell meaning respectable young man 
without any deficiency of useful understanding ork now ledge of the world 
she had already satisfied herself that he thought ha r r i e tab e a u t if u l 
girl which she trusted with such frequent meeting sat hart field 
was foundation enough on hiss idea n don ha r r i e t s there could be 
little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all 
the usual weight and efficacy and hew as really aver y pleasing 
young man ay o un g man whom any woman not fastidious might like 
hew as reckon e d very handsome his person much admire ding e n era l 
though not by her there being a want of elegance off eat u re which 
she could not dispense with : butt he girl who could beg rat if i e d 
by a robert martin s rid in g about the country to get walnut s 
for her might very well be conquer e d by m re l ton sad m i ration 
chapter v 
i don o t know what your opinion maybe mrs west on said m r knight l e y of 
this great intimacy between e m ma and ha r r i e t smith but it hin kit a bad thing 
a bad thing ! do your e ally think it a bad thing why so
